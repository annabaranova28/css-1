    <h1>Minamata</h1>
    <h2>2020</h2>
    <p>The 1970s. War photographer Eugene Smith, on
        assignment from Life magazine, returns to Japan, where an
        environmental disaster is unfolding in the small coastal town
        of Minamata. It is from there that Smith will make a report
        that will shake the whole world, take the greatest shots in
        the history of photography and go through a difficult path of
        overcoming and knowing himself.</p>

        <div class="beautiful-element">The Minamata is one of Johnny Depp's most successful projects in recent years.
